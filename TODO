OK Review simonmcc patches
   Not pulling them in because it breaks a lot of assumptions

    - not using tanukiwrapper as service manager
    - managing and installing redis within the logstash module 
    - installing logstash itselve from file download rather than a Package
    - creating users inside a module (this wil for sure break with other users) 
    - using template append which is obsolete rather than concat.
